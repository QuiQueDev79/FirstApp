# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this project as a personal project for a worthy cause.

My uncle Ramon needs medical attention, and my wife decided to hold a raffle. Speaking of raffle numbers, I decided to create a web app where everyone who wants to contribute can choose a number and enter their information.

I'm just getting started in this beautiful world of programming, so I turned to ChatGPT.

It actually turned out well. I spent several hours correcting errors, but ChatGPT also helped me.

Thanks OpenAI!
